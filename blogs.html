      <h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-section">
      <h3>1.1 Current Automation Pyramid</h3>
      <p>Most industries today rely on Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)-based automation. PLCs receive data from sensors and based on their programmed logic, send commands to output devices like actuators to perform actions, such as starting or stopping specific machines.</p>
      <p>The next layer in PLC systems is SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), which operates through centralized software. SCADA collects data from multiple PLCs across a facility and visually displays this information for operators to monitor and control operations efficiently.</p>
      <p>Above SCADA lies the Manufacturing Execution System (MES), a separate platform designed for production management. SCADA systems provide real-time shop floor data to MES platforms, which process this data to deliver actionable insights, such as identifying bottlenecks or calculating Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE). For optimal integration, MES and SCADA systems from the same vendor enable MES to send commands back to SCADA, facilitating adjustments to machine operations in line with production requirements.</p>
      <p>At the apex of the pyramid is the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. ERP handles business-level functions, such as tracking customer orders, monitoring raw material availability, assessing production status, generating reports, and enabling material procurement. From a business management perspective, ERP acts as the organization's brain, using production data from MES to ensure smooth transitions from inventory management to production and delivery.</p>
      <p>Simply put, if you look at this process top down:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ERP:</strong> Focuses business level activities such as demand, supply, and inventory management.</li>
        <li><strong>MES:</strong> Manages and optimizes production processes, including scheduling, resource allocation, and quality control, using data from SCADA systems.</li>
        <li><strong>SCADA:</strong> Provides live shop floor data and ensures operational smoothness, aligned with MES directives.</li>
        <li><strong>PLC:</strong> Captures real-time data from sensors deployed on the shop floor, executes actions based on its predefined program logic, and communicates this information to the SCADA system for centralized monitoring and control.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although PLC-based automation systems have been pivotal in advancing industrial operations since the 1990s, they are not without limitations. Over time, evolving requirements and technological advancements have exposed several gaps and challenges that must be addressed to meet today's industrial demands.</p>
      <p>Traditional PLC/SCADA systems, while foundational in industrial automation, face limitations in adaptability and precision, primarily due to their binary logic (YES/NO outputs). These constraints hinder proactive planning and decision-making in scenarios requiring nuanced variability, such as temperature monitoring. As operations scale, these limitations compound, reducing the usability of data for actionable insights.</p>
      <p>Upgrading to smart monitoring systems with advanced sensors, edge computing, and AI-driven analytics offers a transformative solution. These systems enable predictive maintenance, real-time insights, and flexible responses to dynamic variables, ensuring operational efficiency, enhanced equipment longevity, and data-driven decision-making aligned with modern industrial demands.</p>
